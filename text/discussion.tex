The resulting fit from our linear regression can then be used for mapping
MCA channels to gamma-ray energy. For routine lab meaurements and estimations,
experts often time only use two energy measurements from a single source to determine a linear fit
\cite{gilmore_2011}. While a linear fit is generally sufficient, some
specific applications may require nonlinear fitting. This can easily be accomplished
my creating a feature matrix using higher powers of the measured centroids $C_i$ and
again fitting with ordinary least squares.
