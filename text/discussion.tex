The resulting fit from our linear regression can then be used for mapping
MCA channels to gamma-ray energy. For routine lab meaurements and estimations,
even such an approach may be more work than necessary. Experts often time only
use two energy measurements from a single source to determine a linear fit
\cite{gilmore_2011}. As we saw above, the model was dominated by a linear term, and
even high energies (e.g., ~1MeV) only saw deviations on the order of one part
per hundred, telling us that a linear approximation is sufficient for our
purposes.
