A nonlinear model was found using linear regression to be

\begin{equation}
E = -15.47 + 0.3589C - 3.749\times 10^{-5}C^2 + 4.550\times10^{-9}C^3
\end{equation}

We can see from this fit that the model is dominated by a linear term, but
there are also slight deviations from linearity at high energies. Figure
\ref{fig:fit} shows the fit superimposed on the original data points $(E_i, C_i)$.
