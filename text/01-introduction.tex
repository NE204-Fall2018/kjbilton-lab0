\IEEEPARstart{O}{ne} of the key values of radiation detection and measurement, and in particular, gamma-ray spectroscopy, is the ability to ability to provide information regarding the radiation field at a particular point in space and time.
For terrestrial applications, we often wish to relate a measured radiation field to the material composition of our local environment.
Our ability to relate gamma-ray measurements to our surroundings ultimately comes from the discrete state transitions that occur within nuclei, and in particular, it relies on the energy signatures provided by transitions.
Our ability to identify radionuclides of interest then requires a method to faithfully relate the output signals of our gamma-ray spectrometers to associated gamma-ray lines.

Spectroscopic calibrations are a routine procedure performed on gamma-ray detectors to confidently map electronic signals to operator-interpretable measurements.
In particular, by relating known inputs (i.e., specific gamma-ray source energies) to their respective outputs of our detection systems (i.e., voltages), we can quantitatively determine the mapping from electrical signal to human-interpretable measurements, yielding the ability to characterize gamma rays from additional sources.
