\IEEEPARstart{O}{ne} of the most important uses of gamma-ray detection instrumentation is to identify radionuclides of interest within an environment.
Our ability to identify radionuclides of interest then requires a method to relate the output signals of our gamma-ray spectrometers to associated gamma-ray lines.
Spectroscopic calibrations are a routine procedure performed on gamma-ray detectors to map electronic signals corresponding to measured gamma-ray events to operator-interpretable units (i.e., gamma-ray energy).
In particular, by relating known inputs (i.e., specific gamma-ray source energies) to their respective outputs of our detection systems (i.e., voltages), we can quantitatively determine the mapping from electrical signal to human-interpretable measurements.
By performing calibrations with known sources, we gain the ability to characterize gamma rays from additional sources.

In this work, we consider calibration procedures for high-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray detectors.
While there are significant differences between HPGe and other common gamma-ray detectors, namely scintillation detectors (e.g., \ce{NaI(Tl)}), the methods described here can be followed as such detectors.

The remainder of this paper is outlined as follows.
\Fref{sec:meth} describes the methods involved in performing calibrations.
\Fref{sec:res} shows results for performing spectroscopic calibrations on measured gamma-ray spectra.
\Fref{sec:disc} closes with a discussion of results.
